### Scholarship Filtering Bot for uOttawa
There are over 1600 scholarships listed on uOttawa's website: [Scholarship List](https://uottawa.syntosolution.com/general-directory). By applying the available filters, I was able to reduce the list to 239 scholarships relevant to my profile. Using Selenium and PyPDF, I developed a scraper that excludes pdfs containing specific keywords (for example, *Francophone/French → I'm neither; athlete → I'm not an athletic scholarship recipient*).

Using this bot, I reduced the scholarship list from **239 to 51**, making it much more manageable to review manually. I have also used the bot to generate similar lists with different parameters for friends in biomedical sciences, rather than computer engineering like myself, saving them time as well.
